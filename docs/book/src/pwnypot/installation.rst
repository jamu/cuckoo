============
To use Cuckoo with support for PwnyPot you need to pull the pwnypot_integration branch from the git-repository `github.com/jamu/cuckoo`_.
It provides you with the latest development branch of Cuckoo combined with all files to configure PwnyPot through the Cuckoo submission API. It already contains PwnyPot.dll inside the folder 'dll' of the windows analyzer module.
